**UNFORTUNETLY I PUT THE BOOK DOWN AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET BACK TO IT.  AS 
A RESULT I AM ARCHIVING THIS REPO.  I PLAN ON RESUMING READING THE 
BOOK AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTRURE AND WHEN I DO I WILL UNARCHIVE THE REPO.  HOWEVER, 
I DON'T THINK I WILL BE WRITING ANY EXERCISES IN SWIFT.  MOST LIKELY
I WILL BE USING JAVA OR GO**
